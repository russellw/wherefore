python wherefore.py OPT_ASSUME_COMPLETENESS \src\eprover
The `OPT_ASSUME_COMPLETENESS` option is defined in the file `e_options.h` in the code base. It is part of a list of possible options that can be passed to the prover. Here is a snippet of the code where `OPT_ASSUME_COMPLETENESS` is defined:

```c
\src\eprover\PROVER\e_options.h:   {OPT_ASSUME_COMPLETENESS,
\src\eprover\PROVER\e_options.h-    '\0', "assume-completeness",
\src\eprover\PROVER\e_options.h-    NoArg, NULL,
\src\eprover\PROVER\e_options.h-    "There are various ways (e.g. the next few options) to configure the "
\src\eprover\PROVER\e_options.h-    "prover to be strongly incomplete in the general case. E will detect"
\src\eprover\PROVER\e_options.h-    " when such an option is selected and return corresponding exit "
```

This indicates that using the `assume-completeness` option configures the prover to be strongly incomplete in the general case.

In the file `eprover.c`, there is a case where `OPT_ASSUME_COMPLETENESS` is used:

```c
\src\eprover\PROVER\eprover.c:      case OPT_ASSUME_COMPLETENESS:
\src\eprover\PROVER\eprover.c-            assume_inf_sys_complete = true;
\src\eprover\PROVER\eprover.c-            break;
```

In this context, when `OPT_ASSUME_COMPLETENESS` is encountered as an option being passed to the prover, it sets the variable `assume_inf_sys_complete` to true, which presumably triggers or enables some behavior related to assuming completeness within the prover.

Overall, `OPT_ASSUME_COMPLETENESS` seems to be an option that can be set to configure the prover to assume completeness in its reasoning, with specific effects on the behavior of the prover when solving problems.
